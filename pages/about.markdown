title: About me
---
I'm Benny Hallett. I live on the Central Coast of NSW, Australia with my wife and son.

I got my hands on my first PC when I was 12, and just about to head into high school. My parents bought it to help my studies, but it mostly helped my find new games to play. It was games that would lead me down the programming path, making adventure games for my school projects and building websites for my gaming clans.

My language progression was less than typical. I started on [Hypercard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard), then branched off into [Lingo][1] using [Macromedia Director](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director). I focussed on Java for a long time after that, before making the switch to C# and thoroughly enjoying it. My career has now lead me down the Ruby path, and I'm currently learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).
